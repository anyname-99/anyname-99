## About Me
I am a learner in the ALX Front-End Developer Program and I want to revamp my GitHub profile to make it stand out in my job search.

I started software engineering because I love creating digital experiences that solve real problems for people and I am inspired by how technology can change lives for the better.

My aim is to become a Full Stack Developer, so I am excited to work on projects that involve interactive web apps, dashboards, WordPress sites and tools that improve communication or access to information.

I enjoy learning new technologies every day, practicing good design and writing code that is clear and easy to maintain.
